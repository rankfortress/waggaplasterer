	If you have an old or period property, renovations may reveal traditionally constructed lath and plaster walls. Made of horizontally secured strips of wood (known as “laths”), layers are built up on top in the form of a layer called about quarter-inch deep with another one that sits just below it which is less than half-inch thick, followed by successive coats until the desired height is accomplished. Lath and plaster construction has been used for hundreds if not thousands of years across the world without much change to this day. It can be chosen because it’s sensitive enough when restoring work that needs to take place in timber-framed houses and because it’s a cheap method of wall construction in comparison to other materials.
